# Company analyzer

### System requirements

- Maven
- JDK (Java 22)



### Introduction

The application reads a CSV file representing a company's org structure and performs a basic analysis of its
reporting chains and the managers' pay relative to their subordinates.

The findings of the analysis are printed in the console.

If no file path is supplied, the application uses a default file from its classpath.

For simplicity (due to time constraints), the referenced files must be on the classpath.
